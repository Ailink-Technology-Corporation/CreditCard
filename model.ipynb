    "* On one hand, it can help you accure credit, which in turns help you **buy properties, build your business**. \n",
    "* On the other hand, it can drag you into debt quagmire.\n",

    "So, the purpose of this modeling is to find a good credit card, just good for your buying power, and not drag you to over-purchase.\n",

    "## Without SSN? \n",
    "Some credit card doesn't **require SSN**, for example, BOA's credit card.   \n",
    "The good side of it was, you can apply it and use it for oldest credit line,   \n",
    "and when you get SSN, you can link the card to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of credit line\n",
    "Credit line is composed of several parts:   \n",
    "* **On-Time Payments**: a lot impact\n",
    "* **Oldest Credit Line**: a lot impact\n",
